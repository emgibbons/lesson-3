      		<p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <span>width: 100%;</span>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <span>font-family: monospace;</span>.</p>

      		<h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
      		<p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a <span>div</span> for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
